# M-16 - I implemented the option to upload image by file - Nicolas Barrera

- I changed the forms where before the images were uploaded by url, now I implemented the possibility of uploading the images choosing them from the files stored on my computer.

# M-19 - Reaction like & dislike - Nicolas Barrera

- Implement the functionality to like and dislike the manga, in order to add interaction between users and the creators of the manga.
Some things need to be polished, such as rendering, handling it with redux, to show me the action that was performed when reacting and rendering the component correctly.
I also added a "MyReactions" page, where all the users' favorite manga are stored, offering the possibility to re-read those manga that I liked in the past.
