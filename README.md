Mercado Pago Integration:

1-Access the official Mercado Pago API site: https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/es.

2-Register on the site and request the test credentials, such as the Public Key and Access Token.

3-The Public Key is a special code that will allow you to connect the frontend of your application with Mercado Pago.

4-Create a part of the project called "frontend" (visible part of the application) where the donation options will be shown and the interactions with the user will take place.

5-Install a library called "@mercadopago/sdk-react" using a special command (for example, npm install @mercadopago/sdk-react).

6-In the frontend, create a page or a special component that displays the donation options and the corresponding button.

7-Use the Public Key to establish a secure connection between your application and the Mercado Pago API.

8-Create the necessary logic to send the donation information to the backend when the user selects an option and clicks the donation button.

9-Show the user the result of the transaction and provide a clear message to inform about the success or failure of the operation.
